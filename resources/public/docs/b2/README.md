## Create a Project

```js
npm create vite@latest
```

    - project name : b2
    - framework : react
    - variant : javascript

```js
cd b2
npm install
npm run dev
```
## File Structure
There are number of ways to approach this project. We will introduce commonly used professional file structure. Its a good practice to keep components group in one folder inside a `components` folder inside `src` folder.

```css
b2/
|-- public
|-- src/
â”‚-- |-- components/
|-- |-- |-- formComponents/
|-- |-- |-- |-- InputField.jsx  
|-- |-- |-- |-- SubmitButton.jsx 
|-- |-- |-- |-- SumForm.jsx 
|-- |-- App.css
|-- |-- App.jsx
|-- |-- index.css
|-- |-- main.jsx
|-- ...
|-- index.html

```

## Clean App.jsx

Open `App.jsx` and remove some of the code to make the file look like as below. Alternatively, you can paste the following code in the `App.jsx`

```js
import './App.css'
function App() {
  return (
    <>
    </>
  )
}
export default App
```
